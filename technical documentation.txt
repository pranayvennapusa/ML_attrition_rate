Employee Attrition Prediction System: Technical Documentation
1. Overview
This documentation describes a machine learning–based employee attrition prediction system implemented with Python and Flask, utilizing the IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition dataset. The system enables HR teams to forecast employee turnover, understand underlying causes, and take proactive retention actions.

2. System Architecture
Frontend: Web-based interface for HR users; form inputs for employee attributes (e.g., age, tenure, satisfaction, overtime status)

Backend: Flask API serving ML models, hosting endpoints for predictions, model info, and recommendations

ML Model: Trained Random Forest (or ensemble) classifier on IBM HR Attrition data; interpretable via SHAP/LIME for feature importance

Modules:

Data preprocessing: Missing value handling, encoding, normalization

Prediction API: Receives user input and returns attrition probability, contributing factors, and tailored recommendations

Dashboard: Visualizes employee risk levels and model performance metrics

3. Data Description
Dataset Used: IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition dataset

30+ features (Age, Department, Job Satisfaction, Monthly Income, Overtime, etc.)

Download dataset from Kaggle

4. Data Pipeline & Processing
Cleaning: Remove/Impute missing values (mean/median/KNN)

Encoding: One-hot encode categorical fields (department, job role)

Scaling: Normalize numeric values (income, years)

Feature Engineering: Create new relevant features (work-life index, promotion rate)

Balancing: SMOTE used for class imbalance

5. Model Training
Algorithm: Random Forest (can be replaced with Logistic Regression, XGBoost, SVM, Ensemble models)

Train/Test split: 80/20

Hyperparameter tuning: GridSearchCV

Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC

Explainability: SHAP for feature impact scoring

6. API Endpoints
Endpoint	Method	Description
/	GET	Loads web dashboard
/predict	POST	Accepts employee data, returns risk score, explanations
/model-info	GET	Provides model accuracy, features list, sample outputs
7. Output Description
Attrition Probability: 
0
 to 
1
0 to 1 or percentage

Risk Level: HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW

Contributing Factors: List with impact scores

Recommendations: 2–5 tailored retention actions

Dashboard Metrics: Overall performance, usage logs

8. Deployment
Deployed using Gunicorn, can be containerized with Docker

Supports cloud platforms (Heroku, AWS, Azure, GCP)

9. Integration Guidance
Can be embedded in HRMS suites via API

Dashboard can be linked to BI tools for visualization

Security: Role-based API access, data encryption recommended
